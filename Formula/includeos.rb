		You also have to install the IncludeOS remote and configuration profiles. 
		
		This can be done automatically by executing the following command:

		conan config install https://github.com/includeos/conan_config.git

		Note that this will overwrite your existing Conan profiles and
		remotes, unless you also set CONAN_USER_HOME to point to an
		unused location (default is ~/.conan).
